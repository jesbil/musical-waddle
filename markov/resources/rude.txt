You are really really really bad.
You really need to work on your form.
You really need to really stop sucking.
You suck.
You should stop suck.
You are really really really bad.
You could work as a statue with your movement.
Try to hit the ball next time.
Better luck next time.
Are you even trying?
You must be kidding.
You really need to work on your form.
You stink!
You stink as if i am behind a horse.
I did not even try and i still crushed you.
You are bad.
You are really bad.
HAHA!
You are the worst.
Easiest game of my life.
You are overrated.
I did not even break a sweat.
Too easy.
I crushed you.
I could have been playing with my left hand.
You are the type of player to get 3rd place in a 1v1 match.
You are the human equivalent of a participation award.
Garbage player.
Bettet luck next time.
This was a waste of time.
Stop wasting my time.
You are the worst.
I am better than you.
You will get over it.
Easy game.
